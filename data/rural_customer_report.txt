2. Purchasing Patterns:
Through analysis of sales data and regional trends, several key purchasing behaviors have been identified:
•	Seasonality: A marked increase in purchases during harvest season and holiday periods (Christmas, Easter, and Thanksgiving). The sales spike can be attributed to events like local fairs, farmers' markets, and holiday-specific goods.
•	Product Preferences:
•	Farm Equipment and Tools: High demand for durable, cost-effective products during spring and fall for farming activities.
•	Home Improvement: A strong preference for local, affordable home improvement products.
•	Health & Wellness: Increased interest in vitamins, organic foods, and health supplements, especially during flu season.
•	Personalized Goods: There is a noticeable demand for customizable or locally relevant products, such as region-specific farming tools or home décor that reflects local culture.
•	Brand Loyalty: Rural customers show a stronger sense of loyalty toward brands that demonstrate genuine investment in the community. However, they are more price-sensitive than urban customers and tend to shop based on value and word-of-mouth referrals.

3. Customer Behavior Insights:
•	Digital vs. In-Store: While many rural customers make purchases in-store, an increasing number are shifting to online buying through mobile phones, particularly for products that are not easily accessible locally. However, delivery times can affect customer satisfaction, as rural areas often face delays.
•	Influencer Impact: Local figures such as farmers' association leaders, church pastors, and community event organizers have significant sway over purchasing decisions. Partnering with these figures for local advertising or even community sponsorships could increase brand visibility.
•	Customer Engagement: Sales reps report that rural customers often prefer to engage in face-to-face interactions rather than relying on digital communications. Follow-up calls or personal visits are particularly effective in building trust and closing sales.

4. Data Gaps & Challenges:
While the data we have gathered is invaluable, several key challenges and data gaps have surfaced:
•	Limited Customer Data: There are gaps in data concerning purchasing behaviors in remote regions, especially among older generations who are less likely to use digital tools. Additionally, we are lacking consistent data on loyalty programs or customer retention in these areas.
•	Customer Sentiment: Feedback from rural sales teams suggests that rural customers often feel neglected by the broader corporate structure. There’s a noticeable lack of customized communication and targeted promotions for these regions.
•	Technology Barriers: Many rural customers still struggle with limited or unreliable internet access. Consequently, outreach via mobile-optimized websites and SMS-based offers could prove more effective than email campaigns.
