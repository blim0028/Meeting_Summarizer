Jack Peterson: Good morning, Jamie. I appreciate you coming all the way here to meet with me. I understand you’ve been experiencing some difficulties with our service, and I wanted to address your concerns directly. Why don’t you start by sharing what’s been going on?
Jamie: Thanks, Jack. I’ll be honest with you—it hasn’t been smooth sailing. I’ve been a loyal partner of yours for over five years, but lately, the service has been slipping. Deliveries are delayed, and when I call to follow up, I get passed around from one person to another without clear answers. My customers are frustrated, and so am I.
Jack Peterson: Jamie, I’m really sorry to hear that. I can see why this would be frustrating for you, especially since you’ve been such a strong partner for us. Delays and miscommunication are not what we aim for. Can you tell me when these issues started happening?
Jamie: It started a few months back, around the time you rolled out your new distribution system. I get that changes like that can take time to settle, but it feels like the rural customers are being treated as less of a priority compared to your urban clients.
Jack Peterson: I hear you, Jamie, and I appreciate you pointing that out. The new distribution system was supposed to streamline operations, not disrupt them. Let’s dig into this. Are the delays affecting specific products or orders, or is it across the board?
Jamie: It’s mostly the high-demand items, like the rotary tillers and tractor accessories. I’ve had to deal with customers canceling their orders because they couldn’t wait any longer. And when I call your support team, it’s like they don’t have any answers.
Jack Peterson: That’s not acceptable, and I take full responsibility for that. The high-demand items should have been prioritized during the rollout, especially for trusted partners like you. Let me ask—when you contacted the support team, did they mention if they were escalating the issue to anyone?
Jamie: They said they’d look into it, but I didn’t hear back in most cases. I had to follow up multiple times to get any sort of update. It’s like I’m chasing my own tail.
Jack Peterson: That sounds exhausting, Jamie, and it’s not the level of service you deserve. Here’s what I think we should do: I’ll personally review your past orders and figure out where the bottlenecks are. I’ll also speak with the support team to understand why your concerns weren’t escalated properly. Does that sound fair to you?
Jamie: That’s a good start, Jack, but I need to see more than just a review. What’s going to change moving forward? I can’t afford to lose more customers because of these issues.
Jack Peterson: You’re absolutely right. Here’s what I propose:
1.	Dedicated Account Manager: I’ll assign someone from my team to be your point of contact moving forward. They’ll ensure your orders are prioritized and keep you updated.
2.	Improved Communication: I’ll work with our support team to establish clear escalation protocols so you’re not left hanging.
3.	Priority Status: I’ll flag your account for expedited processing, especially for those high-demand items.
How does that sound?
Jamie: That sounds better, but I need to know this isn’t just lip service. How will you make sure these changes stick?
Jack Peterson: Good question. We’ll set up regular check-ins—say, bi-weekly—for the next three months. During those meetings, we’ll review your orders, address any concerns, and track the improvements. On top of that, I’ll monitor the metrics personally to make sure we’re delivering on our promises.
Jamie: Bi-weekly check-ins sound good. But what about the bigger picture? I’m not the only rural customer facing these issues. If you don’t fix the underlying problems, it’s only a matter of time before others start walking away.
Jack Peterson: You’re absolutely right, Jamie. This isn’t just about fixing things for you—it’s about addressing systemic issues in our rural operations. I’ll bring this up in our leadership meetings and propose a full audit of our rural distribution channels. We need to identify the root causes and make long-term improvements.
Jamie: That’s what I want to hear, Jack. Rural customers like me feel like we’re being overlooked. We don’t need bells and whistles; we just need reliability.
Jack Peterson: I completely understand. Reliability is foundational, and we’ve fallen short. Let me assure you that this is my top priority moving forward. I value your business, Jamie, and I’ll do everything I can to restore your trust.
Jamie: Thanks, Jack. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt for now, but I’ll be holding you to these promises.
Jack Peterson: And I welcome that accountability, Jamie. You have every right to demand excellence, and we’re going to deliver it. Let’s schedule our first check-in for two weeks from today.
Jamie: Sounds good. I’ll look forward to seeing some progress by then.
Jack Peterson: You’ll see it, Jamie. Thanks again for your honesty and for giving us the chance to make this right.
